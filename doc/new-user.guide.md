## Starting the machine

## Logging in for the first time
ITS is designed as an open system, thus some basic functionality is
available even without the need to log in. But to get the full ITS
experience, logging in is recommended.

You do not need to have a preexisting username on an ITS machine
to log in for the first time. Your username will just be created
the first time you log in.
